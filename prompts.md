# Learning Prompts (for ChatGPT)

## Colors

What are some modern, soft color palettes for a flower shop website?

Modern, soft color palettes for a flower shop often use warm and natural tones like blush pink, sage green, lavender, cream, and soft beige.

## Fonts

- How can I change the font on a website using Google Fonts and CSS?
- What's a good Google Font for headings, and another for body text on a flower shop site?

I changed the fonts by selecting Google Fonts, adding the <link> tag to the HTML <head>, and applying the fonts using font-family in CSS. For the design, I used a serif font for headings to make the site feel elegant and a clean sans-serif font for body text to keep everything easy to read.

## Layout

- How do I make a list of items (like cards) display in a row instead of stacked vertically?
- How do I center a group of cards using CSS Flexbox?
- What's a good way to space out sections on a webpage for readability?

To display items like the specials cards in a row, I used Flexbox on the container instead of letting them stack vertically. I centered the cards using justify-content: center and added gaps for spacing. To improve readability, I added consistent padding and margins between sections so each part of the page felt clearly separated.

## Images

How do I make a large image (like a hero) scale responsively while keeping its aspect ratio?

I made the hero image responsive by setting its width to 100% and height to auto, which allows it to scale with the screen while keeping its original proportions.

## Icons

- Where can I find icons to use in a website UI?
- How do I use icons from fonts.google.com/icons on my website?

I found icons using Google’s Material Icons and online icon libraries. I added them by including the icon font in the HTML and placing icons directly in the layout, styling them with CSS like text.

## Map & Contact Info

What are some tips for styling and laying out an `<iframe>`?

For the map iframe, I limited its width, added spacing, and rounded the corners so it matched the rest of the design. This helped the map feel integrated into the page instead of looking like a separate embedded element.
